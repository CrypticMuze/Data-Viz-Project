# Analysis of Road Traffic Casualties Using DV Techniques

## About the Project
A data visualization project done using Python on the topic: Analysis of Road Traffic Casualties Using DV Techniques. This project was undertaken for a project component during the academic year 2020-2021. 

Through Analysis of Road Traffic Casualties, we applied statistical analysis and data visualization algorithms on the Car Accident dataset in an attempt to address the problem of increasing number of road traffic accidents with respect to the steady rise in popuation.

We also created a Machine Learning model that can perform a predictive forecast to further analyze the dataset and make predictions on the severity of an accident. We pused algorithms to discover association laws and hence create a classification model, on which the K-means clustering algorithm will be applied to create clusters. Based on the results of the culminated statistics, association guidelines, classification model, and clusters collected, some safety driving recommendations for increasing safety will be made.

After collecting actionable information from the above analysis, we employed data visualization techniques to create relevant and observable statistics around our analysis. Even though the data collection is limited to a few select attributes, our methodology will derive some valuable and assertable knowledge from it, which can be used to hence make preventive efforts in these areas.
